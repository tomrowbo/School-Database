# School Database Management System

## Description
This program is to simplify the way a school database is ran. In one program it has a login system, allowing all the admin work and students use is done in one place. This was done as part of my A-Level Computer Science Coursework and you can read more in the [Documentation.docx](https://github.com/tomrowbo/School-Database/blob/master/Documentation.docx)

## Usage
To get the program started, you need to clone the code and run the [main.py](https://github.com/tomrowbo/School-Database/blob/master/main.py). From there what you can do is pretty self-explanatory and below are some dummy accounts you can test the features with:
